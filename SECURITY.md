## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of rails-ai seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please do NOT

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO

1. **Report via GitHub Security Advisories**
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/zerobearing2/rails-ai/security/advisories) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Include in your report:**
   - Type of vulnerability (e.g., agent prompt injection, code execution, etc.)
   - Full paths of affected source files
   - Location of the affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability (what an attacker could do)

### What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will send a more detailed response within 5 business days indicating next steps
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Security Considerations for AI Agents

This project involves AI agents that:
- Execute code and commands
- Interact with Rails applications
- Have access to codebases

**Important security notes:**

1. **Agent Prompt Injection**: We take prompt injection vulnerabilities seriously. If you find ways to manipulate agent behavior in unintended ways, please report them.

2. **Code Execution**: Agents can generate and execute code. Report any findings where agents could be tricked into generating malicious code.

3. **Data Leakage**: Report any scenarios where agents might leak sensitive information from codebases.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Report any way agents could be manipulated to perform actions beyond their intended scope.

## Safe Usage Guidelines

For users of rails-ai:

1. **Review Generated Code**: Always review code generated by agents before deploying
2. **Use in Development**: This tool is designed for development environments
3. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys or secrets to repositories
4. **Trust Boundaries**: Understand that AI agents can make mistakes
5. **Sandboxing**: Consider using in sandboxed or containerized environments

## Security Best Practices

We follow these practices:

- Regular dependency updates
- Code review for all changes
- Testing framework for skills and agents
- Following Rails security best practices
- Monitoring for security advisories

## Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and address the issue
- We will release a security advisory once a fix is available
- We will credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We follow responsible disclosure principles
