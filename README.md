# rails-ai

> **EXPERIMENTAL:** Under active development. APIs and architecture may change.

Rails domain expertise for Claude Code. Built on [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) workflows.

## What It Does

Provides Rails-specific workflows and domain skills for Claude Code: ActiveRecord patterns, Hotwire, Minitest/TDD, security, Solid Stack (Rails 8), and 20+ team conventions.

**Six workflow commands** mirror how experienced Rails developers actually work:

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/rails-ai:setup` | Project configuration, gem setup, validation |
| `/rails-ai:plan` | Brainstorm ideas, create implementation plans |
| `/rails-ai:feature` | Implement new functionality |
| `/rails-ai:refactor` | Improve existing code, fill test gaps |
| `/rails-ai:debug` | Fix bugs and broken functionality |
| `/rails-ai:review` | Review code/PRs against TEAM_RULES |

Each workflow command loads the appropriate Superpowers workflows (process) and Rails-AI skills (domain knowledge) automatically.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install Superpowers (required)
claude
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers
/plugin install superpowers

# 2. Install rails-ai
/plugin marketplace add zerobearing2/rails-ai
/plugin install rails-ai
```

### Local Development Install

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zerobearing2/rails-ai.git
cd rails-ai

# 2. Install Superpowers (required dependency)
claude
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers
/plugin install superpowers

# 3. Add local directory as a marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/rails-ai
/plugin install rails-ai@rails-ai

# 4. Restart Claude Code to load the plugin
```

**Run tests before submitting changes:**

```bash
bin/ci
```

## Usage

```bash
# Set up a new project
/rails-ai:setup configure Docker and credentials

# Plan a feature
/rails-ai:plan user authentication with OAuth

# Implement from a plan
/rails-ai:feature implement the authentication plan

# Refactor existing code
/rails-ai:refactor extract service object from UsersController

# Debug an issue
/rails-ai:debug tests failing in user_test.rb

# Review before merge
/rails-ai:review check PR #123 against team rules
```

## Architecture

**Two-layer system:**

- **Superpowers** = HOW to work (brainstorming, planning, TDD, debugging, code review)
- **Rails-AI** = WHAT you're building (11 Rails domain skills + team rules)

Each workflow command combines the right superpowers workflows with the relevant Rails-AI skills for that task.

### Workflow → Superpowers Mapping

| Workflow | Superpowers Used |
|----------|------------------|
| `setup` | verification-before-completion |
| `plan` | brainstorming, writing-plans |
| `feature` | using-git-worktrees, **subagent-driven-development**, brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, verification-before-completion, finishing-a-development-branch |
| `refactor` | using-git-worktrees, **subagent-driven-development**, test-driven-development, testing-anti-patterns, verification-before-completion, finishing-a-development-branch |
| `debug` | systematic-debugging, root-cause-tracing, condition-based-waiting, test-driven-development, verification-before-completion |
| `review` | requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review |

### Rails-AI Skills (11 total)

Domain skills are loaded dynamically based on what the task involves:

1. **project-setup** — Environment config, credentials, Docker, RuboCop
2. **models** — ActiveRecord patterns, validations, associations, callbacks
3. **controllers** — RESTful actions, strong parameters, concerns
4. **views** — Partials, helpers, forms, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. **hotwire** — Turbo Drive, Frames, Streams, Morph, Stimulus
6. **styling** — Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI theming
7. **testing** — TDD with Minitest, fixtures, mocking
8. **security** — XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, file uploads
9. **jobs** — SolidQueue, SolidCache, SolidCable (NO Redis/Sidekiq)
10. **mailers** — ActionMailer, async delivery, templates
11. **debugging** — Rails debugging tools (logs, console, byebug)

## Vision

**Build an AI pair programmer that thinks like a senior Rails developer.**

Rails-AI encodes the patterns, conventions, and hard-won lessons that experienced Rails developers carry in their heads. Instead of generic code generation, it produces code that follows 37signals philosophy, respects Rails conventions, and passes code review on the first try.

The goal: describe what you want to build, and get production-ready Rails code with tests, security, and proper architecture — without babysitting the AI through every decision.

## Philosophy

Opinionated Rails development:

- 37signals philosophy (simple, pragmatic)
- Rails conventions (REST-only)
- Solid Stack (SolidQueue, SolidCache, SolidCable)
- Minitest, not RSpec
- TDD always

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Foundation (v0.1-v0.2)** ✅ Complete
Initial skills, team rules, testing framework.

**Phase 2 — Domain Workflows (v0.3-v0.4)** 🔧 In Progress
Six workflow commands replacing architect coordinator, 11 domain skills, deterministic superpowers integration, coordinator-only pattern with subagent dispatch.

**Phase 3 — Memory & Context**
Index production Rails patterns, wire into local memory + knowledge graph, RAG + SQLite vector search.

**Phase 4 — Fully Autonomous Rails**
Ship end-to-end features complete with tests and security. Target: 85%+ first-pass success rate.
